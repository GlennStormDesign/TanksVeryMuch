## Who, What, Why?
I've been making games with code for over three decades, and since 2009, working with C# (in unity). So, while learning C++ (and before that C) has been challenging in the past, since Sept 2019, I've been able to get past major hurdles and get down to it.

After multiple tests, gameplay prototypes (available on GlennStorm.com), I'm making a more complete experience that should look and feel like a proper game, _and_ it should be properly built in C++. The focus is on making a comprehensive game experience from best practices in C++, including efficiency and elegance.

Work on this project began late February 2020, and repository started here April 21, 2020, as a sandbox version just shy of 'proof of concept'.
